Don't Blame Myclassbot when your grades and marks are really low since you didnt pay any attention to the stuffs that are taught in the class (Unless you are pro or somethihng). I also discourage frequent usage of Myclassbot as it would adversely affect you since you are not studying at all. However, if you are still considering to use Myclassbot, then ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR FINAL EXAM RESULTS._** üòÇ
